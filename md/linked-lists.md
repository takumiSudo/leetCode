A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each of which contains a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. Linked lists can be used to implement dynamic data structures where elements can be efficiently inserted or removed, as they do not require contiguous memory allocation like arrays. Here, I'll provide examples of how to implement linked lists in Python and C++.

### Linked Lists in Python:

In Python, linked lists can be implemented using classes. Each element of the linked list is represented by a node, and nodes are connected by having a reference to the next node in the list.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node

    def display(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

# Usage:
my_linked_list = LinkedList()
my_linked_list.append(1)
my_linked_list.append(2)
my_linked_list.append(3)
my_linked_list.display()
```

### Linked Lists in C++:

In C++, linked lists are implemented in a similar way using classes to define nodes and a linked list class to manage the list.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int data) {
        this->data = data;
        this->next = nullptr;
    }
};

class LinkedList {
public:
    Node* head;

    LinkedList() {
        head = nullptr;
    }

    void append(int data) {
        Node* new_node = new Node(data);
        if (head == nullptr) {
            head = new_node;
        } else {
            Node* current = head;
            while (current->next) {
                current = current->next;
            }
            current->next = new_node;
        }
    }

    void display() {
        Node* current = head;
        while (current) {
            std::cout << current->data << " -> ";
            current = current->next;
        }
        std::cout << "nullptr" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    LinkedList myLinkedList;
    myLinkedList.append(1);
    myLinkedList.append(2);
    myLinkedList.append(3);
    myLinkedList.display();

    return 0;
}
```

In both Python and C++, the linked list starts with a `head` pointing to the first element (node). New elements are appended to the end of the list, and you can display the elements by traversing the list using the `next` pointers. Linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.
